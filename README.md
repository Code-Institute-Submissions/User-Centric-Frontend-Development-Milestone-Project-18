Project Name/Title: Robin Westerback Full Stack Web Developer
Project Description: User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project
My portfolio website to promote me and showcase my work to potential clients/employers. The website is a one-pager with a clean and minimalistic design to lead the user on a journey that ends with the possibility to contact me.
It features an about, projects and contact section as well as images, videos, modals, diagrams, a contact form as well as social links. The page is designed to give the client/employer easy access to relevant information needed before hiring me.
